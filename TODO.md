# TODO: Make Interface Responsive for Mobile and Websites

## Steps to Complete

  - Modify .app-main to use single column on mobile.
  - Make sidebar responsive (e.g., hide or stack below main panel).
  - Reduce padding, font sizes, and margins for mobile.
  - Ensure calendar day cells are touch-friendly (min height, padding).
  - Adjust group selector, legend, and other elements for small screens.
- [x] Test responsiveness by launching the browser and checking different screen sizes.
- [x] Finalize and verify no layout breaks.
